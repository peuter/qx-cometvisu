/**
 * This class demonstrates how to define unit tests for your application.

 * Execute <code>generate.py test</code> to generate a testrunner application 
 * and open it from <tt>test/index.html</tt>
 *
 * The methods that contain the tests are instance methods with a 
 * <code>test</code> prefix. You can create an arbitrary number of test 
 * classes like this one. They can be organized in a regular class hierarchy, 
 * i.e. using deeper namespaces and a corresponding file structure within the
